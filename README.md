Modern looking unreal editor theme
This is the whole Content folder, you only need the changed png's in the commits

I plan to make it easier in a future update

based in part on this theme

https://forums.unrealengine.com/community/general-discussion/1355372-change-theme-of-ue4

and on this theme for the flat blueprints

https://github.com/Sythenz/UE4Minimal

Some of the icons used in the theme are from:
https://feathericons.com



Installation:

1. Navigate to your Engine\Content folder.

2. Make a copy of these two folders: "Editor" and "Slate" this will be your backup if you would like to revert the theme without reinstalling unreal.

3. Download or clone the repo, and copy the "Editor" and "Slate" folders into your Engine/Content folder. You will be asked to override the files, hit yes.

Should you want the Graph Nodes in blueprint/material editor to be the old versions, Do not copy and replace the "Editor/Slate/Graph" folder.

Thats all
